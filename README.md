# GitCli

This project is aimed to create the interfacing to GIT via the Command Line Interface (CLI). This is due to the CLI is always the latest version while library is lacking behind. Furthermore, library for Ruby or Java might not be coming in so soon, being later should be a better in keeping up the changes.

Hence the interfacing with the CLI seems the better way to do that.

This codes are tested using git version 2.25.1, Linux x86\_64 

## Installation

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
